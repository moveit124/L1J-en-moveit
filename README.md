# Sanctuary of Aden (July Build)

This repository contains a snapshot of the **Sanctuary of Aden** server as it existed in July, before I stepped away from the project.

I left due to ongoing toxicity and burnout. At the time, we had talked about releasing this build publicly as a sort of Christmas gift. That never happened, so I decided to upload it myself.

This is not a polished release. It’s a working snapshot of the codebase at that point in time.

Despite everything — Merry Christmas, shitheads. ~_~
